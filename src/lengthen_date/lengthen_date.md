# Lengthen Date

The function `lengthen_date` should take a date in the format '21.03.2017' and return a string in the format 'Tuesday 21st March 2017'

Hint:

- Pythons [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module could come in handy here.

## Examples

```py
lengthen_date('21.03.2017')
# 'Tuesday 21st March 2017'
```
