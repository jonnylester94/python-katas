# Herd the babies

Write a function called `herd_the_babies` which takes a string as its argument.

The string will consist of several 'baby' (lowercase) letters, that belong to a 'parent' (uppercase) letter.

The function should return a string that is sorted alphabetically, with the parent letter coming before its babies.

## Examples:

```py
herd_the_babies("aA") # 'Aa'
herd_the_babies("aBA") # 'AaB'
herd_the_babies("bbaBccAC") # 'AaBbbCcc'
```
